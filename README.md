# Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and is made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. 
This website is designed to help users organize their schedule. 

## How It Works 
The user plans their day by simply typing in the hour block and clicking the save button. The information gets saved on the page and is set in local storage. CSS classes and JS help keep the current hour red, the past hours grey, and the future hours green. The current date is being displayed at the top of the page. The clear button is at the top to clear the planner.
